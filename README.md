## Overview

In this project, the aim is to build a modern tip calculator. The project's primary interface comprises a container labeled "Tip Calculator" with two input fields: one for the bill amount and the other for the tip percentage. The tip calculator has a modern design that is styled using CSS. I utilized JavaScript to obtain the values of the two input fields and calculate the total amount based on these values.
